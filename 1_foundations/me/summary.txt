My name is Muadh Bin Mohammed Ali. I’m an AI Software Engineer and tech enthusiast with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, open-source development, Linux, and security. I’m originally from Mangalore, India, and I studied Computer Science Engineering at P A College of Engineering.

I’ve worked with Azure AI, Microsoft Copilot Studio, LangChain, and MCP, building things like AI-based call systems, orchestrator agents, and company-specific AI assistants. Before that, I spent a lot of time tinkering with embedded systems, development boards, and even built a virtual personal assistant named BAYMAX on Raspberry Pi.

Outside of work, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, and learning how AI can make everyday systems smarter and more secure.
